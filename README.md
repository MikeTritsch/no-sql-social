## What comes next? and other issues...

I always appreciate more practice in creating backend routes. I really took the time to analyze the code as I was writing it, making sure I fully understood what each line was doing. I learned a lot through trial and error in regards to getting nested documents to render and connect with eachother.

I tried multiple times to make user thoughts fully render within the user document thoughts array. I was able to achieve this with the reaction array, where it renders the full reaction object, but was unable to make the thoughts array do the same.

## Installation

    ** REQUIRES NODE **
    1. Clone repo (link found at the top of the README)
    2. Install all dependencies (Express, mongoose) by running:
         npm i <package>
    3. Using MongoDB Compass, insert your personal connection string within the connection.js file
    4. To seed data, run:
        node utils/seed.js
    5. Using a client (Postman, Insomia, Thunderclient) of your choice, run your needed routes
